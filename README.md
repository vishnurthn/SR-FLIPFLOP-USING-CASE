**AIM:**

To implement  SR flipflop using verilog and validating their functionality using their functional tables

**SOFTWARE REQUIRED:**

Quartus prime

**THEORY**

SR Flip-Flop SR flip-flop operates with only positive clock transitions or negative clock transitions. Whereas, SR latch operates with enable signal. The circuit diagram of SR flip-flop is shown in the following figure.

This circuit has two inputs S & R and two outputs Qtt & Qtt’. The operation of SR flipflop is similar to SR Latch. But, this flip-flop affects the outputs only when positive transition of the clock signal is applied instead of active enable. The following table shows the state table of SR flip-flop.

Here, Qtt & Qt+1t+1 are present state & next state respectively. So, SR flip-flop can be used for one of these three functions such as Hold, Reset & Set based on the input conditions, when positive transition of clock signal is applied. The following table shows the characteristic table of SR flip-flop. Present Inputs Present State Next State

By using three variable K-Map, we can get the simplified expression for next state, Qt+1t+1. The three variable K-Map for next state, Qt+1t+1 is shown in the following figure.

The maximum possible groupings of adjacent ones are already shown in the figure. Therefore, the simplified expression for next state Qt+1t+1 is Q(t+1)=S+R′Q(t)Q(t+1)=S+R′Q(t)


**PROGRAM**

/* Program for flipflops and verify its truth table in quartus using Verilog programming.

    module sr_ff (s, r, clk, rst, q);
      input s, r, clk, rst;
      output reg q;

      always @(posedge clk or posedge rst)
    begin
        if (rst)
         q <= 0; // Reset the flip-flop
        else
    begin
          case ({s, r}) // S and R control the behavior
            2'b00: q <= q;    // No change
            2'b01: q <= 0;    // Reset
            2'b10: q <= 1;    // Set
            2'b11: q <= 0;    // Invalid state, typically treated as reset
          endcase
        end
      end
    endmodule
